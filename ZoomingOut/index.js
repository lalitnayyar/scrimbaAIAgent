 * Goal - build an agent that can answer any questions that might require knowledge about my current location and the current weather at my location.
 */

/**
 PLAN:
 1. Design a well-written ReAct prompt
 2. Build a loop for my agent to run in. **
 3. Parse any actions that the LLM determines are necessary
 4. End condition - final Answer is given
 
 */

const systemPrompt = `
You cycle through Thought, Action, PAUSE, Observation. At the end of the loop you output a final Answer. Your final answer should be highly specific to the observations you have from running
the actions.
1. Thought: Describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
2. Action: run one of the actions available to you - then return PAUSE.
3. PAUSE
4. Observation: will be the result of running those actions.

Available actions:
- getCurrentWeather: 
    E.g. getCurrentWeather: Salt Lake City
    Returns the current weather of the location specified.
- getLocation:
    E.g. getLocation: null
    Returns user's location details. No arguments needed.

Example session:
Question: Please give me some ideas for activities to do this afternoon.
Thought: I should look up the user's location so I can give location-specific activity ideas.
Action: getLocation: null
PAUSE

You will be called again with something like this:
Observation: "New York City, NY"

Then you loop again:
Thought: To get even more specific activity ideas, I should get the current weather at the user's location.
Action: getCurrentWeather: New York City
PAUSE

You'll then be called again with something like this:
Observation: { location: "New York City, NY", forecast: ["sunny"] }

You then output:
Answer: <Suggested activities based on sunny weather that are highly specific to New York City and surrounding areas.>
